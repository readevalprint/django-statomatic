So I wanted to run some untrusted code. Javascript looked good because it could
run in the browser (a natural sandbox). But I needed it to run server side too. 

Pypy popped up on a few sites but it was a bit unclear on the use case for it at
first. But [this helped](http://pypy.org/features.html#sandboxing). Plus, I like
python :)

So here is how to install it on ubuntu. A lot of help came from [this dude](http://www.stephendiehl.com/?p=295) 

I was on his site and [here](http://pypy.org/download.html#translate) every day for a
week.

[UPDATE April 19: Read [Part 2](http://readevalprint.github.com/blog/python-sandbox-with-pypy-part2.html)
for sane output in a normal python wrapper]
<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; sudo apt-get install \

### Get the source and start the translation process

**What is "translating"?**

It's the process of compiling code written in
[RPython](http://code.google.com/p/rpython/) (a statically typed subset of
Python) to the target platform which is by default C.

**Why do we need to do that?**

This goes back to [what Pypy is](http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/getting-started.html#what-is-pypy).
To quote: PyPy is an implementation of the Python programming language written
in Python itself. So combine python written in rpython and a compiler for rpython we
get the ability to compile python code to native C speeds. :)

There are several options you get when doing the translation process, in this
case we need [--sandbox](http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/sandbox.html).
This means that all calls to external libraries or os
calls are passed through an external process that enforces the sandbox. Also the
C code is not segfaultable. The only thing that is availble outside of pure
python is a virtual tmp folder of your specification. And that /tmp folder is readonly to
the program. It's like Inception.*


 \* &lt;tangent&gt; I want to run "eval/exec" in the sandbox and that would **really**
be like Inception.&lt;/tangent&gt;


<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; wget http://pypy.org/download/pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&#36; tar -jxvf  ./pypy-1.4.1-src.tar.bz2
&#36; cd ./pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal
&#36; python translate.py --sandbox
</code></pre>

Grab a bite to eat or a cup of tea and enjoy the mandelbrot fractals.

Read [what translation is doing](http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/translation.html#overview) while
you wait.

.

Now while you are still in ~/pypy-1.4.1-src/pypy/translator/goal

<pre><code>&#36; sudo ln -s &grave;pwd&grave;../sandbox/pypy_interact.py /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py </code></pre> 

Go home!

<pre><code>&#36; cd 
</code></pre>

Make a symlink of the source to /opt

<pre><code>&#36; sudo ln -s &grave;pwd&grave;/pypy-1.4.1-src/ /opt/pypy-sandbox </code></pre>

Now let's test it...

Should see prompt and don't go further if you don't

<pre><code>&#36; pypy_interact.py /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c
</code></pre>

Now let's test the sandbox! Make a dummy file and put it in the virutal tmp folder

This ./virtualtmp **and it's contents** will become /tmp to the sandboxed
interperter.

<pre><code>&#36; mkdir ~/virtualtmp
&#36; echo Good day Sire! &gt; ~/virtualtmp/greetings.txt
</code></pre>

Specify the ~/virtualtmp for /tmp in the sandbox

Note: the --tmp option is always relative to the prompt regardless of absolute
paths put there. So "/some/path/" is not from root and "~/a/path" is not from
home. It's all relative to the prompt.

<pre><code>&#36; pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-c </code></pre>

Note: you'll see logging text as well, output will be in there somewhere ;)

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('/tmp/greetings.txt')
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f.read()
'Good day Sire!\\n'
</code></pre>

Let's try opening it to write
But NO! you cannot!

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; f = open('/tmp/greetings.txt', 'r+')
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<console>", line 1, in <module>
IOError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/greetings.txt'
</code></pre>

[crtl+c to exit]
They suggest installing ledit to have a saner prompt

<pre class="bash"><code>&#36; sudo apt-get install ledit
&#36; ledit python -u /usr/local/bin/pypy_interact.py --tmp=virtualtmp /opt/pypy-sandbox/pypy/translator/goal/pypy-cp
</code></pre>

Continue to [Part 2](/blog/python-sandbox-with-pypy-part2.html) for a wrapper in normal python that gives helpful output
and error managment.

Thanks to JuanCarlos for proofreading skillz and Norm for feedback as positive as
possible.
